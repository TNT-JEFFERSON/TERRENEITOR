# Models

In this directory you will find all the information regarding our 3D printed models, designed and printed by us.

### Adapter

This model is an adapter so we can join together the dc motor and the lego stick. The model has 2 sides: the first one being a cross so the lego stick fits there perfectly and the second one being a line where the dc motor fits. This 3D printed model is an essential part of our final robot's wheel mechanism, since thanks to this model it works.
