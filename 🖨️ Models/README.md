# Models

In this directory you will find all the information regarding our 3D printed models, designed and printed by us.

### Adapter for the wheels

This model is an adapter so we can join together the dc motor and the lego stick. The model has 2 sides: the first one being a cross so the lego stick fits there perfectly and the second one being a line where the dc motor fits. This 3D printed model is an essential part of our final robot's wheel mechanism, since thanks to this model it works.

### Support for pixy with adapter for lego

This model counts with two pieces which support the pixy like a case, it also counts with two holes at the ends so it can be adapted to the lego pieces which our robot is made with.

### Blue piece

This model is a piece that functions to stop the dc motor from moving so it has a better performance. This model what 4 cm x 2 cm so it would in the space below the robot in the first prototype.
