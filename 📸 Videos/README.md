# Videos

In this directory you will find links to:
- Our Youtube channel.
- Videos of our previous prototypes, their circuits, and mechanisms.
- Videos of our final robot's circuits and mechanism.
- Demostrative videos that show our robot completing challenges and showing its speed and velocity.

## First prototype circuit:
- Here we show the whole circuit of our first prototype. It was located at the top of the prototype and was coded and build using Arduino IDE and arduino components.

## First prototype wheels mechanism:
- Here we demostrate the mechanism of the back wheels of our first prototype and the incredibly fast velocity and speed it had.

## First prototype direction mechanism:
- Here we show how the direction mechanism of our first prototype wasn't working (this problem was mentioned in "Our journey, progress and prototypes" in the README of the repository)

## Second prototype on the track:
- Here we show how our second prototype was on the track. Though it was very slow, it completed the challenge successfully.

## Second prototype's circuit:
- Here we show the circuit of the second prototype

## Final robot's direction: 
- Here we demostrate the ability to turn from one side to another (and the mechanism to do so) of our robot:

## Final robot on the ground:
- Here we demostrate Terreneitor's speed and fast velocity on the ground.
