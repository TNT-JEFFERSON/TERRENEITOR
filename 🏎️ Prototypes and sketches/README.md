 # Prototypes and sketches 

In this directory you will find all the information regarding our previous ideas and prototypes, their avantages and disavantages and the journey that lead to this prototypes. It is important to mention that we are going to focus here on the sketches and prototypes, not on the final robot (if you want to know more about our final robot, check the other folders like:`vehicle photos` folder, the `build` folder, etc. You can also read the README of this repository since we mainly talk about our final robot there and , as mentioned before, in the other folders except for this one).

- Now, _why is there a need to talk especifically about our sketches and prototypes?_

It is a need and an importance to talk about our sketches and prototypes because they have lead the way and gave us an incredible help for our final robot. They have shaped the way our final robot is today. It is important to have this in mind because, if you read "Our journey, progress and prototypes", you will see how it was a journey that started with a lot of downfalls but eventually we realized to learn from our mistakes and we recovered, making Terreneitor, our final robot.

### Sketches

Before we even started building the robot, we had a clear vision for what we wanted our robot to be like. We wanted a robot with 2 or 3 ultrasonic sensors (especially 2 in the front), the pixycam in the middle of the front of the robot (between the 2 ultrasonic sensors), to have 4 wheels (2 in the front, and 2 in the back like a real car), use 1 dc motor to move both back wheels, and have the batteries and arduino board behind the sensors (in the middle of the base). In the sketches below you can see these ideas reflected:

### First prototype

After making the sketches for what we wanted our robot to look like, we started the construction by using lego pieces from the _MINDSTORM education EV3_ lego set. As mentioned before, we wanted the both of the back wheels to move by using 1 dc motor who would move them simultaneously.
