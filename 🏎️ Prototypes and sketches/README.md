# Prototypes and sketches 

In this directory you will find all the information regarding our previous ideas and prototypes, their avantages and disavantages and our the journey that lead to this prototypes. It is important to mention that we are going to focus here on the sketches and prototypes, not on the final robot (if you want to know more about our final robot, check the `vehicle photos` folder, the `build` folder and "Our journey, progress and sdlds" in the README of this repository)
