# Build

In this directory you will find what our robot is made of: all the lego pieces, arduino/electrical components, and materials used in the final robot.

What is Terreneitor made of? Terreneitor is made essentially of:
- Pieces and lego parts from the _MINDSTORMS education EV3_ lego set
- While also using electrical components and arduino components
- And our own parts and materials like personalized 3D printed models, silicone and tape

In the chart below titled "The lego pieces our robot uses are:", you will find:
1) First, the amount of that especific piece we used on the robot
2) Second, the color of that lego piece
3) Third, the code of that lego piece
