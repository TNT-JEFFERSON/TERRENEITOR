## Code

In this directory you will find all the code (using Arduino IDE) we used for our prototypes and the final robot.

## Code for the motors of the second prototype:

- What this code does is simple: 

   - First, it makes the robot go in a straight line (having both motors on)
   - Wait 
   - then turn (by turning off one motor while the other one is still on)
   - and then go in a straight line again (turning on both motors, like in the beginning).

The robot does this cicle 4 times, for it to finish that round, which is the first challenge (the open challange).

- You can see this code being used and putted to the test in "Second prototype on the track"(in the videos folder)
