# `TNT` - `TERRENEITOR`

## About

This repository provides information and knowledge regarding the current progress, evolution, and development of our self-driving robot vehicle for the World Robot Olympian (WRO) 2024 competition in the category Future Engineers, which is build and coded by us.

## TNT & Terreneitor - WRO 2024 Future Engineers

The name of our team is TNT, we chose this name because we will _explode_ the comptetition with our hard work and dedication! On the other hand, Terreneitor is the name of our autonomous robot. We are a group of Venezuelan high schoolers who yearn to learn and be masters in robotics. TNT also have plenty of objectives like:

* Obtain expertise and mastery in robotics, engineering and self-driven robots.
* Learning how to cooperate and work as a team to solve problems with ingenious, imaginative, and creative solutions.
* Acquire knowledge regarding new and old technologies, information about eletronics, hardware, software, and more.
* Gain experience for opportunities or competitions that we might face in the future.
* Win the competition and enjoy the process through this exciting road.

TNT is form by three members (all 15 y.o.):

  - Raffaella Salama Arias
  - Emiliana Raquel Guerrero Ferm√≠n
  - Nicola Pasquale Simone Perdomo

## Our journey, progress and prototypes

In the beginning of our journey, we had plenty of various and diverse ideas on how to build our robot but eventually it all worked out. When we first started, we did messy sketches and tried a lot of ideas. Here are some of our first sketches and ideas for Terreneitor:
