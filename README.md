# `TNT` - `TERRENEITOR`

## About

This repository provides information and knowledge regarding the current progress, evolution, and development of our self-driving robot vehicle for the World Robot Olympian (WRO) 2024 competition in the category Future Engineers, which is build and coded by us.

## TNT & Terreneitor - WRO 2024 Future Engineers

The name of our team is TNT, we chose this name because we will _explode_ the comptetition with our hard work and dedication! On the other hand, Terreneitor is the name of our autonomous robot, build by using lego and arduino together. We are a group of Venezuelan high schoolers who yearn to learn and be masters in robotics. TNT also have plenty of objectives like:

* Obtain expertise and mastery in robotics, engineering and self-driven robots.
* Learning how to cooperate and work as a team to solve problems with ingenious, imaginative, and creative solutions.
* Acquire knowledge regarding new and old technologies, information about eletronics, hardware, software, and more.
* Gain experience for opportunities or competitions that we might face in the future.
* Win the competition and enjoy the process through this exciting road.

TNT is form by three members (all 15 y.o.):

  - Raffaella Salama Arias
  - Emiliana Raquel Guerrero Ferm√≠ns
  - Nicola Pasquale Simone Perdomo

## Materials and components

What is Terreneitor made of? Terreneitor is made of pieces and blocks from the _MINDSTORMS education EV3_ lego set, while also using electrical components, and arduino components.

## Our journey, progress and prototypes

In the beginning of our journey, we had plenty of various and diverse ideas on how to build our robot but eventually it all worked out. When we first started, we did messy sketches and tried a lot of ideas. Here are some of our first sketches and ideas for Terreneitor:

Eventually, with theses sketches in mind, we started working on the physical robot. We had high hopes for our first prototype, and the more we worked on it, the more our hopes grew. But, there was a problem, a big one...if you see "First prototype wheels mechanism" (you can find in the "videos" folder) you might think, like us, that it would be super fast on the ground, however when we finally were ready to put to this test... it failed. The wheels mechanism of this prototype did not work on the ground. We tried to change many things and pieces in this prototype to see if it would help, but all our work was in vain, the mechanism still did not work on the floor. And also the mechanism for the direction of the robot did not work out too, although that was a minor problem compare to the mechanism problem.

But, not everything went wrong with our first prototype because we also did a circuit for the servomotor and for the wheels, and we had a base (constructed by us with lego). All of this things helped us, along with our previous mistakes, to improve and create our second prototype.

In our second prototype, since we learned from our failures and errors from the past prototype, didn't had any enormous problem, however, we realized that the two dc motors we had weren't working simultaneously, which violated the rules of the WRO 2024 competition.
